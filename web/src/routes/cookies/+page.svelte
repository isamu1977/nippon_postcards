      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that are placed and stored on your computer
        or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make
        websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide
        information to the owners of the site. Cookies allow websites to
        recognize your device and remember information about your visit, such as
        your preferences or items in a shopping cart.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also use other similar technologies (like web beacons, pixels,
        log files), but we will refer to all of these collectively as <span
